No Update

* \[WIP\] Proposal to remove the Growth Stage [#650](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/650)

AI to Jory - ask the groups in the growth stage to weigh in

* Should we have a lightweight mechanism to spin off ad hoc CPC working groups? [#649](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/649)
Merged the related PR #667

council/pull/647)

AI to Jory - see about transferring this issue / PR

* Simplify proposal process [#635](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/635)

Comments resolved and PR merged
Would be good to update the directory structure, that can be an alternative issue/PR

* Provide implementation guidance for DCO/CLA [#632](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/632)

No Update for today - folks out

* Develop annual review process for projects [#592](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/592)

May be blocked on some the issues around what to do with Growth plan
May need to change the charter if we do 
Question: Do we want to do review processes for all projects?
Lighter weight, survey would be a possibility
Jory volunteers to tackle the broader “non growth” proposals - open a new issue that is broader 
Update labels & RM agenda label for now on this particular issue


### Review process discussion

Questions for projects:
* How are you doing?
* Are you planning anything big
* Are you planning on winding anything down
